# Book_management_system
This is a database course design, the topic is the book management system, more specifically the bookstore management system

Having two "copies" of a file name may feel awkward, but it's a minor problem.
It's a good idea to learn before you start running files: applications access databases. This was the last experiment I did while learning about databases.
I used VS2022 to create a Windows Forms application.Then design the UI interface according to the function to be realized, and then complete the creation of the database (and the table in it) and the writing of the code.
